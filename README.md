# mstring - small footprint managed string library in C
**mstring** is a small footprint **managed** string library written in `C99`. Its purpose is to simplify managing string in standard C programs, without the need of fiddling around too much with pointers. **mstring** is going to be unit tested with a **common** unit testing framework for the C language ([CTest](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/-/wikis/doc/ctest/Testing-With-CTest) - click the link for more info).
